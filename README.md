# E-commerce-project
This is my first GitHub repo, created to host and manage the codebase for an E-commerce website project. It showcases frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on responsive design, user-friendly UI and modular code. This project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate practical skills in building real-world web applications
